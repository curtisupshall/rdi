    # Step 1: For each candidate anchor string, gather all reads belonging to it
    for anchor in anchors:
        
    
        break
        # Step 2: For each read, we have O(1) access to all its (repeated) kmers. Using these, we can cluster the reads
        
        # Step 3: Simply yield the largest cluster.
    
    # Step 4:  Given each cluster, align all the reads on the candidate anchor string, then take the average
